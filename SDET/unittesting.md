* junit
* mockito
* unit testing vs test driven development
  * unit testing - find defects late: collect and arrange, write test, recognize and report
  * tdd - start with the requirements -> tests -> code
    * good practices:
      * plan tests
      * use significant names
      * avoid complexity
      * one functionality, one test
      * only write code when a test fails
      * keep tdd automated
 
# tdd, bdd, atdd (acceptance test ..)
* tdd more technical, same lang as code, feature implementation
* bdd feature behavior
* atdd feature requirement capturing
