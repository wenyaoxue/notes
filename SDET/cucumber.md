cucumber acceptance automation can be used through java, ie in a maven project
# install

# pom.xml maven dependencies
* https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.cucumber/cucumber-junit
* https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.cucumber/cucumber-picocontainer
* https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.cucumber/cucumber-java
* and selenium pom.xml maven dependencies
* and restassured pom.xml maven dependencies (except 1. instead of sl4j, log4j/log4j 2. no jackson-databind 3. also org.codehaus.groovy/groovy-all
# `.feature` files
* create in a folder `Feature` in project
* `#` comments
## `Feature:` - app/component name
## `Scenario:` - action description \n + given when then structure; or `Background:` perform before each scenario or `Scenario Outline:` perform one scenario for each dataset (see parameters > DataTable > multi data) or `???` perform after all scenarios (ie once)
## `Given` scenario precondition \n `When` user performs an action \n `Then` check expected result
* ie follow each keyword with a high level phrase, which will be used to annotate the implementations
* join phrases in a clause with `And`, `But` - same functionality
### parameters
* eg for input data (when), expected vals (then), etc.
#### literal injection
* feature phrase includes `"LITERALSTRINGVALUE"` <-> implementation annotation phrase includes `{string}`
* implementation method takes and uses parameter type `String`
#### DataTable
* feature data format - each new line/row: `| VALUE | VALUE |` (i think it must be a regular table, same number of cols per row)
* implementation method takes and uses parameter type `DataTable`
  * DataTable has method `asLists` - no arguments, returns type `List<List<String>>` - eg use to get(rowi).get(coli)
* single data: underneath phrase (must be on a new line), include feature data
* multi data:
  * add clause to the end of the Scenario Outline: `Examples: with multiple data` + new line + feature data (any number of rows)
  	* in the first row, each column VALUE should be DATACOLTITLE
  * instead of `Scenario:`, use `Scenario Outline:`
  * relevant feature phrase includes `"<DATACOLTITLE>"` <-> implementation annotation phrase includes `{string}`
  * implementation method takes and uses parameter type `String`
  * will generate one scenario for each example (num rows - 1 for column titles)
## run
* right click > Run As > Cucumber Feature
  * scenarios will be performed (-> pass/fail)
	* if step definitions (APPLICATIONPageStepDefinition class) are not implemented, console output will include method stub snippets
* can be batch executed - see src/test/java/com.TestRunner
# src/test/java/com.StepDefinition
* AbstractPageStepDefinition.java - hold, initialize, and return WebDriver variable
* APPLICATIONPageStepDefinition.java
	* subclass of AbstractPageStepDefinition, getDriver()
 	* eg in each method (generated by running feature) have a few selenium statements, eg driver.findElement.click...
* other methods
  * annotated `@After`
    * will be executed after every scenario (where the class is used I think)
# src/test/java/com.TestRunner
* annotate class TestRunner_Main.java
  * `@RunWith(Cucumber.class)`
  * `@CucumberOptions(OPTIONSSEPARATEDBYCOMMAS)`
    * `features = {"NAMEOFFEATUREFOLDER/NAMEOFFEATUREFILE.feature"}`
    * `glue = "NAMEOFSTEPDEFINITIONPACKAGE"`
    * `dryRun=false` - pass/fail based on - false: performing scenarios, true: checking scenarios are implemented (if fail, Failure Trace window will include snippets for unimplemented methods)
    * `monochrome=true`
    * `plugin  = {"pretty","html:CucumberReport/Report.html"}` - after execution, refresh, this report file will be created
    * tags
    * ?? missed the slide
* run as junit test
# it appears:
* each scenario creates an instance of the stepdefinition implementation that the methods are found in (ie variable declaration and assignment in APPLICATION... whatever is reexecuted, abstract...def is not)
* scenarios are performed in order, ie if using the abstract page's driver = using the same browser
