* and restassured pom.xml maven dependencies (except 1. instead of sl4j, log4j/log4j 2. no jackson-databind 3. also org.codehaus.groovy/groovy-all
# `.feature` files
* create in a folder `Feature` in project
* `#` comments
* Feature:
* Scenario: Given When Then And
* right click > Run As > Cucumber Feature
  * scenarios will be performed (-> pass/fail)
	* if step definitions (APPLICATIONPageStepDefinition class) are not implemented, console output will include method stub snippets
* can be batch executed - see src/test/java/com.TestRunner
# src/test/java/com.StepDefinition
* AbstractPageStepDefinition.java - hold, initialize, and return WebDriver variable
* APPLICATIONPageStepDefinition.java
	* subclass of AbstractPageStepDefinition, getDriver()
 	* eg in each method (generated by running feature) have a few selenium statements, eg driver.findElement.click...
# src/test/java/com.TestRunner
* annotate class TestRunner_Main.java
  * `@RunWith(Cucumber.class)`
  * `@CucumberOptions(OPTIONSSEPARATEDBYCOMMAS)`
    * `features = {"NAMEOFFEATUREFOLDER/NAMEOFFEATUREFILE.feature"}`
    * `glue = "NAMEOFSTEPDEFINITIONPACKAGE"`
    * `dryRun=false` - pass/fail based on - false: performing scenarios, true: checking scenarios are implemented (if fail, Failure Trace window will include snippets for unimplemented methods)
    * `monochrome=true`
    * `plugin  = {"pretty","html:CucumberReport/Report.html"}` - after execution, refresh, this report file will be created
* run as junit test
