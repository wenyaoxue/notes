# tools:
* jira
* testrail
* rally
* alm
* ms excel
* agile: agile, waterfall, vmodel, incremental, iterative

# automation
* selenium - library/tool for ui automation; functional verification of web based application
  * includes an IDE, WebDriver (browsers, use programming language, conditions), and Grid
  * open source (free)
  * supports multiple languages (Java, JS, C#, Python, Ruby)
  * supports multiple OSs (Windows, iOS, Linux)
  * supports adding other 3rd party libraries (along with selenium)
  * easy to use
  * portable
  * record/playback tool
  * domain specific language
  * any platform
  * architecture
    * library for different client languages; json wire protocol over http; browser driver <-reference-> real browsers
  * for java, just need an IDE, selenium webdriver maven dependency or jar file, browser driver
  * browser, not window-based - need the HTML element objects
* other tools:
  * QTP Microfocus UFT, rational functional tester, watir, silktest, auto it, soapui, appium, postman, cypress, protractor, katlon
* automate - high risk, repetitive, tedious, time consuming, don't automate - new, frequently changing, adhoc
* scope
* benefits - faster, wider coverage, more reliable/consistent/cheap/accurate/efficient/reusable/frequent/thorough
* thick client - desktop based app / mobile app
* many types of tests, as long as you know the expected result
* tool features
  * environment support
  * ease
  * database support
  * object identification
  * image testing
  * error recovery testing
  * object mapping
  * uses scripting language
  * support for types of test
  * support for testing frameworks
  * debuggable
  * reports/results
  * required training
# maven is a build management tool - auto-download dependencies at runtime
# testing
* testng and junit are alternatives
* junit open source
* both provide assertion library and annotations
## testng
* more specific for testing, esp functional, next generation
* provides HTML reports (not just pass/fail)
* more annotations
* supports grouping and prioritization of testcases
* supports parallel testing
* generates logs
* efficient, simple, powerful data parameterization

# others

bdd cucumber
mocha.js, chai.js - like junit/testng but for js instead of java
